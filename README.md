## System Structure
#### flexible sensor
The flex sensor will be about 25kÎ© under normal conditions, and the resistance value will be increased after bending. The value from flexible sensor will be changed when bending. Without bending, the value is about 250 ~ 270, while the flex sensor is bent, the output value will drop greatly to around 130 ~ 150. After several tests, I observed that the numerical change of the resistance is linear. Therefore, I deduced a linear formula to be my transform approach to imitate the real-word fingers angles .
